## What is KanvasBuddy?
KanvasBuddy is a Python plugin made for Krita, a free professional and open-source painting program. KB is a small dialog that floats on top of the canvas packed with enough features to let you spend as much time in Canvas-Only mode as possible. The idea behind KB was to provide the 20% of tools used 80% of the time in the most out-of-the-way GUI possible. Its features are very similar to that of Krita's own Pop-Up Palette, but tries to be more space efficient by showing features more selectively.

KanvasBuddy features:

- A wide selection of Krita's dockers. Right there when you want them, then hidden away when not in use!
- Slider controls for the opacity, size and flow of brush presets. Specific values can also be entered by simply typing.
- Quick buttons for toggling Canvas-Only Mode, Mirror Canvas and Reset Zoom, and more.

## New in version 0.4
+ Configurability! You can now choose which dockers, sliders and buttons to appear on KB. This is done by editing the **config.ini** file in the script folder (it's just a text file).
+ The previous point has enabled the addition of many different dockers, such as the Palette Docker, Tool Options and Onion Skins.
+ Updated sliders that mimicks Krita's own "slider sponboxes". They're better featured, clearer, and more space efficient!
+ Added a manual for the Python Plugins section of Krita's settings 

## Who is KanvasBuddy for?
KB is best suited to someone who's already well-versed in Krita's shortcut commands. The plugin isn't meant to replace the entirety of Krita's UI, just the most essential features needed to be able to work in Canvas-Only mode.

## Known issues
- KB can't borrow the Tool Options docker if it's set to be in Krita's tool bar.
- Issues on Linux based operating systems are being looked into, so please provide any information you have on them! Linux doesn't love my sets of hardware, but I'll do my best to work them out.
- KB features virtually no crash handling. Should KB crash you might need to restart Krita in order for KB to work again.
- Sliders and values doesn't synchronize properly between KB and Krita due to limitations in the API. This is only a visual error and does not affect functionality. 

Disclaimer: this plugin has been developed by someone better described as a 'code bodger' rather than a programmer. **Beware of spaghetti.** The plugin works well for me personally, but unfortunately I can't guarantee it'll work well for people on other systems or machines.
